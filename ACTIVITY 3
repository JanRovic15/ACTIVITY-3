<h1> MY THIRD ACTIVITY </h1> 
<p> Good day! Let's try THE CSS ACTIVITY </p>

<h2><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"><img src="google.png"width="150" height="150"> </a> </h2>

<p>Google is an internet search engine. You can 

search anything in Google picture, videos, and 

article you want to find. It's also one of a good 

source of informations for people.Google is also 

student friendly because it can help us to find 

answers to our research and assignments.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank"><img src="facebook.png"width="150" height="150"> </a> </h2>

<p>Facebook is a social networking app that people 

use to connect to other people whenever they are. 

I choose this because it's easy to use and most 

people use this app to communicate with other 

people.I can also share pictures, music, videos, 

and articles, as well as my own thoughts and 

opinions. </p>


<h2><a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank"><img src="twitter.png"width="150" height="150"> </a> </h2>

<p>Twitter is also an social networking app. This is 

much easier to use than facebook since twitter is 

like a blog posting app. i choose this because i 

can get much sorted update here in the groups i 

supported.Also it's not complicated to use.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"><img src="youtube.png"width="150" height="150"> </a> </h2>

<p>Youtube is a video streaming app. You can search 

videos you want to watch in this app. The app is 

also easy to use and easy to navigate. You can 

watch and listen music here. I choose this 

because aside from watching TV or reading books 

you can watch and gather information here. </p>


<h2><a href="https://www.shopee.ph" target="_blank"><img src="shopee.png"width="150" height="150"> </a> </h2>

<p>Shopee is a E-Commerce App or E-Shopping 

app.Unlike Lazada, Shoppee is much more user 

friendly. You can find variety of goods here and 

you can also sell things here. I choose shoppee 

because it's easy to shop and find things here 

it's also convenient if you don't want to shop 

outside your house. </P>
